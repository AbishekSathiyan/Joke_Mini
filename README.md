# Responsive Web UI with Winky Sans Font

This is a responsive web UI design created using HTML and CSS, featuring the "Winky Sans" font from Google Fonts. The design is intended to be mobile-first and responsive across different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both small and large devices.
# Responsive Web UI with Winky Sans Font using React, Redux, and CSS

This is a responsive web UI design built using **React**, **Redux**, and **CSS**, featuring the "Winky Sans" font from Google Fonts. The application is designed to be mobile-first, providing a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the UI works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **State Management with Redux**: Redux is used to manage the application's state, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Interactive Components**: The app includes buttons, dropdowns, and form elements with smooth hover and focus effects to enhance interactivity.
- **Developer Info Section**: A profile section with a developer's image, name, and social media links is included, and it adapts to smaller screens for a user-friendly experience.
- **Custom Font**: The app uses "Winky Sans" from Google Fonts to give the design a modern look.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The buttons, selects, and content boxes have transitions to add smooth hover effects and animations.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, making it easy to build reusable components and manage state.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, helping manage the app's state in a centralized store.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the layout and components, utilizing Flexbox and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Google Fonts**: The "Winky Sans" font is used for a modern, clean design.
- **React Redux**: Used to manage and centralize application state across multiple components.

## Installation & Usage

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbishekSathiyan/Joke_Mini.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in a code editor** (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) to modify or view the HTML and CSS files.

3. **Open the HTML file in your browser**:
   - You can open `index.html` directly in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
   - The design should adapt according to the size of your browser window or device.

4. **Customize the content**:
   - Edit the `index.html` file to change the text, links, or images.
   - Modify `style.css` if you'd like to tweak the design or adjust responsiveness.

## How It Works

### 1. **Global Styles**
   - All elements are styled using the "Winky Sans" font.
   - The layout uses Flexbox for flexible positioning of elements.
   - The body has a dark background (`#2c3e50`) to provide contrast with light-colored content boxes.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - The page is optimized for mobile devices first, with styles for screens larger than 480px defined in media queries.
   - At screen sizes of 1024px, 768px, 767px, and 480px, the layout adapts by adjusting padding, font sizes, and layout direction of the developer profile section.

### 3. **Interactive Components**
   - **Buttons**: Styled to be visually appealing with hover effects that change color and add a subtle scaling animation.
   - **Select dropdown**: Styled with a bright color and a hover effect that changes its background color.

### 4. **Developer Profile Section**
   - Displays the developer's name, image, and social media links.
   - The layout is designed to be flexible, so on smaller screens, the image and links stack vertically.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of this project by opening the `index.html` file in your browser or hosting it on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more interactive elements like forms or modals.
- Implement JavaScript for further interactivity (e.g., form validation or dynamic content).
- Consider adding animations or transitions using CSS animations or libraries like Animate.css for additional flair.
